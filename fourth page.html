    <p>Needlepoint has been a hobby of mine for about 2 years, but in the last year I’ve taken it up more seriously.</p>
  </div>
<div><div class="body1">
<p>I got to work at a local needlepoint shop in Nashville over Christmas break, where I got to learn from the pros.</p>
</div>

<div class="body2">
<p>Needlepoint gives me an outlet that doesn’t put any pressure on me.
I get to make whatever I want and express my style and passions through it. 
I love having something physical to have a hold as proof of my effort.</p>
