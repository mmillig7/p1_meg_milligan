<p>For me personally, I am obsessed with needlepoint.</p>
<p>Recently, it's been kind of bad.<br>Like, I'm so addicted</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Now for some needlepoint tips,<br><div>Cut a strand from the skein of thread. We suggest cutting your thread so that it is the length of your finger to your elbow - or no longer than 18".<br> Fold the thread over the needle in between your thumb and index finger, and pinch the end of your thread so that it is folded over onto itself. Remove the needle from between the thread. Take the folded thread and push it through the eye of the needle. Another option is to push the end of the thread through the eye of the needle. If the end of the thread has frayed, twist it to make it tighter and eliminate the fray (or trim the end with scissors) before pushing it into the eye of the needle.<br>Tie a knot in the end of the thread farthest from the eye of the needle. This is called a “waste knot.” Place the waste knot on top of the canvas by pushing your needle through the canvas from front to back, roughly an inch away from where you plan to start stitching.<br>Using one of the stitches below, stitch over the "tail" of the waste knot (the thread on the back of the canvas) to lock your thread into the canvas. Once you have stitched up to the waste knot, cut the knot off the front of the canvas. Be careful not to cut the canvas itself!<br>Once you have finished stitching a particular area, or your thread has become too short, you will need to end your thread. Flip your canvas over. With the needle and thread on the back of the canvas, run your needle through the previously placed stitches. Trim off the excess thread with embroidery scissors.<br>Once you have stitched a substantial area of canvas, there is no need to do a waste knot. You can start your thread by running it under four or five of your previously placed stitches in the same way that you learned to end your thread. Repeat this action a second time in order to securely lock in the thread before you begin stitching.</p></div>
